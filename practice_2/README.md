# Practice 2 - Localizer

The primary task of the localizer is to determine the vehicle's position on the map. This can be done using GNSS ([Global Navigation Satellite System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation)), using lidar or using camera. In this practice we are focusing on localization using GNSS, as this is the easiest to implement and suffices for simpler experiments.

In this practice, we will use logged data from the car [Novatel PwrPak7D](https://novatel.com/products/receivers/enclosures/pwrpak7d) GNSS sensor. Novatel system combines the absolute GNSS positions with relative IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements to improve accuracy. The accuracy is further improved by using stationary ground base stations within RTK ([Real-Time Kinematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_kinematic_positioning)) system. In addition to location it also determines the speed of the vehicle from consecutive locations.

The data is saved in the rosbag file in the `common` package. The GNSS log is recorded in the `/novatel/oem7/inspva` topic. This topic includes two kinds of data:
* **location**, given as latitude, longitude and height,
* **velocity**, given in directions of north, east and up.

The task of localizer in this case is very simple - it must take the latitude and longitude, coordinates in [WGS84 system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System), and convert them to the map coordinate system. For the map we are using the UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) zone 35N projection. Using projection to [Cartesian coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) is common in processing geospatial data, because it makes calculating distances between points and other transformations much easier.

#### Additionally provided:

##### in `common`
* `data/bags/ride_14_minimal.bag` - filtered rosbag that contains GNSS log
* `data/trajectories` - folder for waypoint files and one example file

##### in `practice_2`
* `nodes/planning/waypoint_saver.py` - node for waypoint saving
* `launch/practice_2.launch` - a launch file that should run without errors at the end of the practice using your localizer node and also launch waypoint recording
* `rviz/practice_2.rviz` - RViz config file for visualizing the topics. RViz is a 3D visualization tool for ROS.
* `config/localization.yaml` - some parameter values for localizer. Instead of using launch file to set parameter values a file can be loaded where the parameters are listed.

### Expected outcome

* Understanding what does it mean to localize a car on the map
* Your localizer node will convert the measured location from the GNSS system to map coordinates
* As a result, we are able to recorde a trace of the car into a csv file and can make the car follow that trace in the next practice


## 1. Create localizer node

We will create a [subscriber node](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29#rospy_tutorials.2FTutorials.2FWritingPublisherSubscriber.Writing_the_Subscriber_Node). The node will get access to the data when we will [play a rosbag](https://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Commandline#rosbag_play).

##### Instructions
1. Create a new file called `localizer.py` inside `~/autoware_mini_practice/src/practice_2/nodes/localization`
2. Copy the following code as a starting point to your node. What to note:
   - See how the node is organized as a class - it is a good practice to agree on some common style when writing a code. Let this be an example of current good practice
      - ROS node is created in [`if __name__ == '__main__':`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html#idiomatic-usage) block and then class method `run()` is called
      - organize the code in meaningful groups in class init method 
      - other code should be inside callbacks and functions
   - Go through the necessary imports and note different message types
   - Notice that this time we are using `/` prefix for parameter names. This is because these parameters can be potentially used also from other nodes. Previously we used `~` prefix that denotes node private parameters. More information on resolving parameter names can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/Names#Resolving).
   - See how subscribers and publishers are created
3. There is an empty callback: `transform_coordinates` - replace `pass` with printing the coordinates `print(msg.latitude, msg.longitude)`

```

class Localizer:
    def __init__(self):

        # Parameters
        # self.undulation = rospy.get_param('/undulation')

        # utm_origin_lon = rospy.get_param('/utm_origin_lon')

        # Internal variables
        self.crs_wgs84 = CRS.from_epsg(4326)

        rospy.spin()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    rospy.init_node('localizer')
    node = Localizer()
    node.run()
```

##### Validation
* As a reminder lets run first all the nodes manually
* In terminal 1: `roscore`
* In terminal 2: `rosbag play ride_14_minimal.bag` - need to be in the same folder where the rosbag is or enter it with the relative path. Bag files are under `common` package directory `data/bags`.
* In terminal 3: run the localizer node (`python localizer.py`) and see if the coordinates printed out are roughly similar to the following:

```
latitude:  58.377320927441524  longitude:  26.73093522060624
latitude:  58.37732063697093  longitude:  26.730934613622136
latitude:  58.377320343735214  longitude:  26.730933999096404
...
```
* Close all runnning processes in terminals
* Inside localizer node in parameters section uncomment getting the three parameter values (`undulation`, `utm_origin_lat`, `utm_origin_lon`)
* run `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch`
   - we should see the same coordinates printed out in the console
   - all necessary things like playing the rosbag, running the localizer node, and opening rviz with visualization are included in the launch file.


## 2. Convert coordinates

Latitude and longitude printed out in the previous task are geographic coordinates in [World Geodetic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) (with [EPSG code 4326](https://epsg.io/4326)), or more commonly referred as GPS coordinates. Our localizer needs to transform these coordinates to UTM zone 35N projection ([with EPSG code 25835](https://epsg.io/25835)) as used for the map. Additionally, we have defined a custom origin point near the Delta building that needs to be subtracted from transformed coordinates. For coordinate transformations, we use the [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/) library.

##### Instructions
1. Create the coordinate [Transformer](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/transformer.html) using the defined [CRS](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/crs/crs.html) objects.
2. Use the Transformer to transform the origin point (so that it can be later subtracted from the transformed coordinates).
3. Both of the previous should be done only once in the class initialization 

```
# create coordinate transformer
self.transformer = Transformer.from_crs(self.crs_wgs84, self.crs_utm)
self.origin_x, self.origin_y = self.transformer.transform(utm_origin_lat, utm_origin_lon)
```
4. `self.transformer` can be used also inside the callback to transform the coordinates from INSPVA message
5. Add also subtracting the transformed origin coordinates and replace the previous printout in the callback with the current results


##### Validation
* run `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch`
* output should be similar to this:

```
x:  269.20194537803764 y:  -894.3992087505758
x:  269.1676822404843 y:  -894.4305393118411
x:  269.1329317893251 y:  -894.4622026216239
...
```

## 3. Publish `current_pose`

As a next step, we must publish transformed coordinates to a `current_pose` topic. The message type for this topic is [PoseStamped](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/PoseStamped.html). When you look at the message definition, it contains:
   * [Header message](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Header.html) that has
      * `seq` - sequence id, int number that is increasing with every sent message
      * `stamp` - contains the timestamp of the message of type **time**
      * `frame_id` - reference frame name. Right now we will put just `map` here, reference frames will be explained more in future practices.
   * [Pose message](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Pose.html) consists of two parts, each referring yet to another message type:
      * `position` (message type [geometry_msgs/Point](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Point.html))
         - `position.x` and `position.y` are the transformed coordinates with subtracted origin coordinates
         - for `position.z` we need to take `msg.height` and subtract `undulation` (parameter)
      * `orientation` (message type [geometry_msgs/Quaternion](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Quaternion.html)). Quaternions are a way to represent orientations in 3D space that have [many favorable properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation).
         * From GNSS topic we have azimuth - angle from north in clockwise direction (we will be ignoring the car's roll and pitch angles currently). Essentially, we need to convert the azimuth angle to quaternion.
         * GNSS azimuth is in the WGS84 system, we need to correct it for the UTM zone 35N projection first. The correction depends on location and is also known as [meridian convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection#Convergence). This can be found with [get_factors](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/proj.html#pyproj.Proj.get_factors) method, see the example code below. The correction should be subtracted from azimuth angle coming from the message.
         * Next thing is we need to convert angle from **clockwise (CW)** angle from **y axis** (north) to **counterclocḱwise (CCW)** angle from **x-axis** (this is how angles are usually represented in ROS). Let's call this angle **yaw**. For that, the function `convert_azimuth_to_yaw()` is provided in the code below.
         * And finally, we need to convert the angle to quaternion; you can use the `quaternion_from_euler` for that.

```
# calculate azimuth correction
azimuth_correction = self.utm_projection.get_factors(msg.longitude, msg.latitude).meridian_convergence

# convert azimuth to yaw angle
def convert_azimuth_to_yaw(azimuth):
    """
    Converts azimuth to yaw. Azimuth is CW angle from the North. Yaw is CCW angle from the East.
    :param azimuth: azimuth in radians
    :return: yaw in radians
    """
    yaw = -azimuth + math.pi/2
    # Clamp within 0 to 2 pi
    if yaw > 2 * math.pi:
        yaw = yaw - 2 * math.pi
    elif yaw < 0:
        yaw += 2 * math.pi

    return yaw

# Convert yaw to quaternion
x, y, z, w = quaternion_from_euler(0, 0, yaw)
orientation = Quaternion(x, y, z, w)
```

##### Instructions
1. Create the PoseStamped() message
2. Use previously provided code to calculate x, y, z values and orientation
3. `stamp` should be taken from the INSPVA message header
4. `frame_id` should be `"map"`
5. Publish `current_pose`

```
# publish current pose
current_pose_msg = PoseStamped()
current_pose_msg.header.stamp = 
current_pose_msg.header.frame_id = 
current_pose_msg.pose.position.x = 
current_pose_msg.pose.position.y = 
current_pose_msg.pose.position.z = 
current_pose_msg.pose.orientation = 
self.current_pose_pub.publish(current_pose_msg)
```


##### Validation
* run `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch`
* `rostopic echo /localization/current_pose` should see messages published similar to this:

```
header: 
  seq: 1420
  stamp: 
    secs: 1698739108
    nsecs: 206858580
  frame_id: "map"
pose: 
  position: 
    x: 206.55750858492684
    y: -861.8742412924767
    z: 0.0
  orientation: 
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.9144929346097534
    w: 0.4046018691860446
```

## 4. Publish `current_velocity`

Velocity is represented in `/novatel/oem7/inspva` messages with three components: `north_velocity`, `east_velocity` and `up_velocity`. We will use only the north and east components and take their norm.

Message type in `current_velocity` is [TwistStamped](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TwistStamped.html), and we are going to write the calculated velocity to `twist.linear.x` and say that `header.frame_id` equals to `base_link`. `base_link` is a common way to name the robot's/car's main reference frame where the x axis points forward. That is why we are calculating the norm and writing it only to `twist.linear.x`.

##### Instruction
1. Calculate the velocity as norm of the `north_velocity` and `east_velocity`
2. Create TwistStamped message
3. Create the message 
   * Set frame as `"base_link"` 
   * Take a time stamp from GNSS message
   * Assign velocity to `msg.twist.linear.x`
4. Publish to `current_velocity`

##### Validation
* run `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch`
* `rostopic echo /localization/current_velocity`, similar messages should appear


```
header: 
  seq: 567
  stamp: 
    secs: 1698739091
    nsecs: 147263737
  frame_id: "base_link"
twist: 
  linear: 
    x: 3.9187759208925708
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
  angular: 
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0

```


## 5. Create and publish transform

As a last thing, our localizer needs to publish the transform between the `map` frame and the `base_link` frame. This allows later for conversion of map coordinates (e.g. traffic light locations) to vehicle local coordinates (e.g. in camera reference frame).

For that, you need to use [TransformBroadcaster() from tf2_ros](https://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials/Writing%20a%20tf2%20broadcaster%20%28Python%29) library. That is already imported and created. It uses message type: [geometry_msgs/TransformStamped](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/TransformStamped.html)

1. Create the TransformStamped message
   - `frame_id` is `map`
   - `child_frame_id` should be `base_link`
   - timestamp should come from the GNSS message
2. Transform consists of translation and rotation that are basically current_pose's position and orientation. Basically to convert (0, 0) in `base_link` frame to `map` frame, you just need to add the current position.
3. Use `sendTransform()` to publish the transform (TransformStamped message)


```
# create a transform message
t = TransformStamped()

# fill in the transform message - t

# publish transform
self.br.sendTransform(t)

```

##### Validation 
* `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch`
* Rviz should open with a similar visualization. Location information is played from the rosbag, your localization node transfrms them into UTM Zone 35N coordinates, and also waypoint recording is launched.

![saved_waypoints_img](doc/saved_waypoints.png)

* Big red arrow in front is the location of `current_pose`
* Smaller arrows depict the recorded waypoints, waypoint itself is at the beginning of the arrow and the arrow shows the orientation
* White number on top of the waypoints shows speed in km/h
* The color of the waypoint arrow shows the blinker
   - blue - right turn
   - green - straight
   - red - left turn

If you open the recorded csv file then the contents should look like this:
```
x,y,z,yaw,velocity,change_flag,steering_flag,accel_flag,stop_flag,event_flag
268.60110718221404,-894.9431115202606,0.0,-138.0360894928333,2.7723594859024563,0,0,0,0,0

...
```
* `x,y,z` - waypoint coordinates in map frame
* `yaw` - yaw angle in degrees (CCW from x-axis). A negative angle "turns the direction around"
* `velocity` - speed of the car
* `steering_flag` - blinker information
* other columns are currently not used


## 6. Launch file arguments

If you open the launch file, you can see three arguments in the beginning
* `bag_file` - specify the bag file name
* `interval` - define spacing between waypoints
* `waypoints_file` - define output waypoints file name

These arguments can be specified when you run the launch file. The tab key is beneficial here because of auto-complete. Try to enter the same roslaunch command `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch` by hitting the tab key at various steps.

Additionally, enter the tab key at the end and see the arguments appear. For example, try the command with arguments `roslaunch practice_2 practice_2.launch interval:=5 waypoints_file:=waypoints_5m.csv`
